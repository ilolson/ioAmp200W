# Toolchain Installation

Contains a script that installs the Raspberry Pi pico toolchain (and extras, for I2S) onto your machine and the additional dependancies required to build the application. *Run as sudo.*

Verified to work on macOS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (ARM and Windows through WSL2, reccomended), this goes for the ```qbuild.sh``` script in the above directory.

```qbuild.sh``` skips dependancy and toolchain checks for fast build times.
